# GuedelPlot

![Basic Guedel plot](Guedel_Plot.png?raw=true)

An iPython notebook to reproduce the Guedel-Benz plot, including the Benz-Guedel relation. The papers regarding the plot and relations are:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993ApJ...405L..63G/abstract/">Guedel and Benz 1993</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994A%26A...285..621B/abstract">Benz and Guedel 1994</a></li>
</ul>

The notebook isn't the prettiest ever, but the values had to manually entered due to the age of the papers. So even if it's messy, it saves you a lot of data entry XD
